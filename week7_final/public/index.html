        <div class="first-text">My name is Nico, and I want to thank you for your time.</div>
        <div class="second-text">I know the time we have together is short, but I hope to make it meaningful.</div>
        <div class="fourth-text">Each question you answer will illuminate the path, hopefully, to feeling lighter.</div>
        <div class="fifth-text">I want you to know that whoever you are, I care about you. </div>
        <div class="sixth-text">I'm here for you, 
        
        to support you, 
        
        to listen to you. 
        
        I see you. </div>

        I know I am asking a lot of you, 
        
        when you may not have the capacity to be vulnerable with me.

        Please consider this simply as an invitation - will you help me create this experience for you?
